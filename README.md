## Slack Pipeline tool

A Free-range Friday project

Deploy pipeline queue management using slack commands. Creates a queue on a per-channel basis

Use the following commands in your squads channel:

	/pipe help ---- See this help message
	/pipe status ---- See the current queue for the pipe
	/pipe take ---- Add yourself to the production pipe queue
	/pipe release ---- Release the pipe

## Todo
